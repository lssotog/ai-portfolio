        In 2020 I was the mentor of Globant's "Women in the Cloud" programming
        seedbed program, which aimed to approach and include Colombian girls and
        adolescents in vulnerable situations into the world of technology,
        specifically web programming. Our goal was to inspire and plant the seed
        for more women to join IT.
